How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It automated finding the differences quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see what changes I've made and see the progress.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You get to choose a logical stopping point when to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

That way changes that are related can be found.
