Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would want to keep my work isolated in a sandbox until I was ready to accept remote updates that might cause problems in my testing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is used in GitHub to make a copy from another persons repository to your own.  Basically a clone internal to GitHub that notes where it came from.  clones - used to bring a copy of a repository from a remote to your local machine.  branches - created as a copy of some starting point of a repository and diverges with changes from the point of the copy. To put changes back into the original a merge must be performed.
